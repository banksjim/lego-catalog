  "notes": {
    "1": "Created docs/enhancements/cloud-deployment-guide/detailed-guidance/terraform-modules-complete.md with full working Terraform code. Linked from main guide.",
    "2": "Created docs/enhancements/cloud-deployment-guide/detailed-guidance/terraform-state-management.md focused on solo developer needs: manual operations, state locking, importing resources, recovery scenarios.",
    "3": "Skipped - multi-region is overkill for 100 users, adds significant cost/complexity.",

    "5": "Skipped - basic single-instance Cloud SQL sufficient for 100 users, HA adds 100% cost.",
    "6": "Skipped for now, but will add reminder paragraph about future testing considerations in appropriate location.",
    "7": "Adding brief paragraph to main guide explaining terraform plan shows drift, with reference to state management doc.",

    "11": "Adding brief section on GitHub Secrets best practices + GCP Secret Manager integration, least privilege patterns, environment-specific secrets, manual rotation.",
    "12": "Adding brief section on custom composite GitHub Actions for multi-repo setup. ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE: Separating infrastructure repo from application repo(s). All environments (dev, prod) managed in one infrastructure repo. Updates required across ALL documents.",
    "13": "Adding brief section on branch protection rules: required status checks, no force push, required PR reviews (solo dev can self-approve), CODEOWNERS, require branches up-to-date.",
    "14": "Adding brief section on GitHub Environments: dev/prod setup in both repos, environment-specific secrets, deployment branch restrictions (main→prod only), environment URLs in GitHub UI.",
    "15": "Adding brief section on dependency caching: actions/cache setup for Go modules and npm packages, cache keys using lockfile hashes, example workflows showing cache configuration.",
    "16": "Adding brief section on artifact management: container image tagging strategies (git SHA, semver), GCP Artifact Registry lifecycle policies, rollback procedures using previous image tags. Noted JFrog as future alternative for learning/employer alignment.",
    "17": "Creating docs/enhancements/cloud-deployment-guide/detailed-guidance/blue-green-deployment-guide.md with exact gcloud commands, traffic splitting procedures (0%→10%→25%→50%→100%), health checks, rollback commands, Honeycomb integration.",
    "18": "Adding brief paragraph explaining Cloud Run traffic splitting provides canary deployment benefits without separate infrastructure complexity.",
    "19": "Creating docs/enhancements/cloud-deployment-guide/detailed-guidance/feature-flags-launchdarkly.md with complete setup, Go/React SDK integration, flag patterns, free tier details. MUST link from main guide.",

    "21": "Creating docs/enhancements/cloud-deployment-guide/detailed-guidance/database-migration-strategies.md with zero-downtime patterns (expand-contract), backwards compatibility, MySQL/Cloud SQL specifics, testing procedures. MUST link from main guide.",
    "22": "Adding rollback procedures section to database-migration-strategies.md: safe rollback patterns, reversible vs irreversible migrations, Cloud SQL point-in-time recovery, data preservation strategies.",
    "23": "Adding emergency hot-fix deployment section to blue-green-deployment-guide.md: when hot-fix justified, minimum safety checks, skip gradual rollout, post-emergency cleanup procedures.",
    "24": "Creating docs/enhancements/cloud-deployment-guide/detailed-guidance/honeycomb-queries-library.md with essential queries section at top (P50/P90/P99 latency, error tracking, deployment impact), followed by additional queries. Living document to grow over time. MUST link from main guide.",
    "25": "Adding brief section on practical SLO starting points: 99% uptime for 1000 users, measuring with Honeycomb, error budget concept, when to tighten SLOs as scale grows.",
    "26": "Adding brief section on alert tuning essentials: alert on user-facing symptoms not causes, appropriate thresholds (error rate >1%), Honeycomb alert setup, page vs email decisions for solo developer.",
    "27": "Adding brief section on distributed tracing essentials: what to auto-trace (HTTP handlers, DB queries), propagating trace context frontend→backend, adding custom spans for key operations, when sampling becomes necessary (>10k req/hr).",
    "28": "Adding brief section on structured logging to STDOUT: Cloud Run auto-captures STDOUT→Cloud Logging, structured JSON format (zerolog/zap for Go), log levels (ERROR/WARN/INFO/DEBUG), what to log vs avoid (no PII/secrets), 12-factor app pattern.",
    "29": "Adding brief section on business metrics via Honeycomb custom events: tracking user signups, searches, feature usage as Honeycomb events instead of separate Prometheus setup. Simpler than maintaining multiple observability systems.",
    "30": "Skipped - Honeycomb error tracking via traces is sufficient, dedicated error tracking tool adds complexity.",
    "31": "Creating docs/enhancements/cloud-deployment-guide/detailed-guidance/real-user-monitoring.md with Google Analytics 4 + web-vitals library setup, Core Web Vitals tracking. Brief future consideration mention in main guide linking to detailed doc.",
    "32": "Adding brief section on GCP Cloud Monitoring uptime checks: setup for 5-minute intervals from 3 regions, /health endpoint, email alerts. Include cost info: 1M checks/month free (5-min checks from 3 regions = ~26k checks/month = $0).",
    "33": "Creating docs/enhancements/cloud-deployment-guide/detailed-guidance/security-hardening-checklist.md with comprehensive OWASP Top 10 guide for Go/React: pre-deployment checklist, detailed mitigation strategies with code examples for each vulnerability, security scanning tools (gosec, npm audit, OWASP ZAP), incident response plan, and security checklists by deployment phase. Will add security verification section to deployment checklist in main guide and link from both main guide and docs/README.md.",
    "34": "Creating docs/enhancements/cloud-deployment-guide/detailed-guidance/secret-rotation-procedures.md focused on MANUAL rotation only (no automation). Will include step-by-step procedures for: database password rotation (Cloud SQL + Secret Manager), API key rotation (Honeycomb, external services), JWT signing key rotation, service account key rotation. Each procedure includes gcloud commands, zero-downtime considerations, and rollback steps. Document emphasizes quarterly rotation schedule for solo developer at small scale.",
    "35": "Adding Automated Security Scanning in CI/CD section to security-hardening-checklist.md (item 33). Will include: GitHub Actions workflows for gosec (SAST) and npm audit (dependency scanning), GCP Artifact Registry container scanning (automatic), expanded Dependabot configuration, scan result interpretation, failure thresholds for blocking PRs, when to run scans (PR/main/scheduled). Approximately 2-3 pages integrated into comprehensive security document."
